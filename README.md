# team-page-constructor

Hi.

This project aims to construct a web page showing the organisational structure of a sample work team. 
The page will be built using a combination of language skills. 
Data is gathered via user's CLI input. 
JavaScript code from the input data is developed using TDD.
Output is then finally rendered to HTML.

The app will be invoked using node index.js, and npm needs to be installed.

The page view is sampled below:

The sample HTML file generated can be found here:
